We appreciate your patience,  but can assure you the Moderation Team is making sure these kinds of concerns are mentioned as directly as possible. \n\nThank you and we're sorry this is happening too.  :emoji_109:\n\nPlease understand the Moderation team are not developers, and are experiencing everything at the same time as you all, and noting these reports to be forwarded ASAP. We noticed it appears to be isolated to Yunya regions (EU & Africa) as of January 17th. We do not know if it will continue to not work tomorrow unfortunately.\n\nGvG Status as of Jan 17th. \nCanglang ✅ \nYunya :z1_X: \nYongu ✅",
