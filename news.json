    "text": "Hey everyone! \n\nWe have noticed a current discord scam where impersonators try to look like our official staff by using a misspelled username, for example [wwmoffical], and DM users with a fake investment idea.\n\nPlease know that the dev team will never send you unsolicited DMs, don't make any payments to these impersonators and don't share any personal information or passwords with them. Report these messages to Discord as scam and let our moderators know through <@1391796610467500064> if you see one in your DMs.\n\nWhen in doubt, verify through official channels (pinned announcements, server staff list, or a mod via GooseMail). Stay safe!",
